  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements but has a critical flaw: the backend admin list is not actually exposed via a query method, and the frontend stores admins entirely in localStorage without fetching from the backend. This violates REQ-1's requirement to 'expose a method to list all administrators' and creates a hallucinated client-side-only admin list that doesn't reflect server state.",
