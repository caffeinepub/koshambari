  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all requirements for replacing 'Gold Jewellery' with 'Lehenga' category. The backend includes enum changes and migration logic, while the frontend updates all relevant components (CategoryFilter, ProductForm, AdminProducts, Home, ProductCard) to display 'Lehenga'. However, the ProductCard fallback image still points to 'product-jewellery.dim_600x600.png' instead of a lehenga-specific image, which may be intentional reuse or a naming inconsistency.",
