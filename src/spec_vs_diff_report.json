The 'Jewellery' category has been successfully added across the backend (main.mo with #jewellery enum variant and migration support), frontend CategoryFilter component (5-column tab grid), ProductForm component (dropdown option), Home page (category card), and ProductCard component (fallback image logic). The spelling 'Jewellery' is used consistently throughout. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
