  "summary": "The diff comprehensively addresses all four requirements with extensive documentation, authentication checks, admin privilege verification, and navigation integration. All requested features appear to be implemented with clear evidence in the modified and added files.",

      "description": "Extensive README documentation with troubleshooting section and first-time setup instructions",
      "reason": "REQ-1 only requested 'verify and document the exact admin panel route URL' with AC for 'route path is documented in the application'. The implementation goes beyond this with a full README guide including troubleshooting, first-time setup, and access instructions that were not requested.",

      "reason": "REQ-2 and REQ-3 requested redirects and error messages, but toast notifications specifically were not mentioned in the requirements. The AC specified 'appropriate error message' for non-admin users, which could be interpreted as the Alert component alone.",

      "reason": "While REQ-2 mentions redirecting unauthenticated users to login, the BuildRequest does not explicitly require creating an elaborate admin login page with instructional UI. The focus was on routing and authentication checks, not UI enhancements for the login experience.",
