# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add administrator privilege management to allow granting and revoking admin access to users.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend methods to grant, revoke, and list administrator privileges
- Add an administrator management page in the admin panel showing all current admins
- Include a form to add new administrators by principal ID and remove buttons for existing admins
- Add a "User Management" link to the admin sidebar navigation

**User-visible outcome:** Administrators can view all current admins and grant or revoke admin privileges to other users through a dedicated management page in the admin panel.
