# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the "Gold Jewellery" product category with "Lehenga" throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Update backend product category enum to replace 'goldJewellery' with 'lehenga'
- Migrate existing products from 'goldJewellery' to 'lehenga' category
- Update all frontend components to display 'Lehenga' instead of 'Gold Jewellery' (category filters, product form, admin table, home page collections)
- Update product fallback image logic for lehenga category

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see "Lehenga" as a product category option instead of "Gold Jewellery" throughout the site, in filters, product listings, and admin interfaces.
