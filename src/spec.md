## Summary
**Goal:** Add Jewellery as a new product category throughout the e-commerce admin panel.

**Planned changes:**
- Add 'Jewellery' category option to the CategoryFilter component on the products page
- Add 'Jewellery' to the category dropdown in the ProductForm component for adding/editing products
- Update the backend ProductCategory enum to include #jewellery variant
- Add Jewellery category card to the Home page category preview section
